If you do not know the answer, just say you don't know the answer given the context. Do not make up an answer.\n\nWhat is Roll-to-Roll Printing? \nWhat a fantastic question. This printing system is where you utilize a full roll of media (DTF film), rather than a single sheet of media, that feeds onto another empty roll at the end of the system. It is a really efficient system if you need to print constantly. It\u2019s almost a set-and-forget type of printer that will print until you run out of media or ink, which is already faster than single feed sheets that cannot be stacked.\nWhen compared to standard printing methods, the process improves printer life cycle costs while also making it easy to scale up your operation. Efficiency is also maximized when manufacturing requires multiple prints. A well-designed roll-to-roll system can make manufacturing quicker and cheaper without compromising quality. \n\nWith individual sheets your prints are limited by the size of the media and if you have a small format printer the prints are even smaller. The only limitation on size for roll printers is, again the size of the media. So instead of a max length of 20 inches for a single sheet we can make a print that is 328 feet long (almost a full football field from post to post). \n\nWe\u2019ve released and promoted several different machines which already utilize this system, like the 24\u201d STS 628D and Prestige XL2 and the large format 1682D. However, there is nothing available for the smaller format printing (under 24\u201d) and this leaves either smaller shops or the hobbyist with not many options under $10,000.\n\nQuestion: What is the price of the Prestige XL2?\n\n            ### Input:\n            \n\n            ### Response:\n            ", "### Instruction:\n            List 5 popular online streaming services.\n\n            ### Input:\n            \n\n            ### Response:\n            ", "### Instruction:\n            What are the most important steps to consider when developing a website?\n\n            ### Input:\n            \n\n            ### Response:\n            ", "### Instruction:\n            List five animal-related activities people enjoy.\n\n            ### Input:\n            \n\n            ### Response:\n            ", "### Instruction:\n            Describe the differences between an asynchronous and synchronous web application.\n\n            ### Input:\n            \n\n            ### Response:\n            ", "### Instruction:\n            Generate a recipe using only these ingredients: onion, chicken, red wine, parsley\n\n            ### Input:\n            \n\n            ### Response:\n            ", "### Instruction:\n            Characterize the following author\n\n            ### Input:\n            J.R.R Tolkien\n\n            ### Response:\n            ", "### Instruction:\n            How does the role of a data scientist differ from a software engineer?\n\n            ### Input:\n            \n\n            ### Response:\n            ", "### Instruction:\n            Identify which animal in the following text is a reptile and explain what characteristics make it a reptile.\n\n            ### Input:\n            The zoo was home to a wide variety of creatures, including a vibrantly colored tree frog, a red-footed tortoise with stunning patterns on its shell, and a fluffy rabbit with soft, huggable fur.\n\n            ### Response:\n            ", "### Instruction:\n            Tell me how many female characters are there in the Game of Thrones?\n\n            ### Input:\n            \n\n            ### Response:\n            ", "### Instruction:\n            Suggest a tool that can be used to test a website's usability.\n\n            ### Input:\n            \n\n            ### Response:\n            ", "### Instruction:\n            What is the most efficient way to cook chicken?\n\n            ### Input:\n            \n\n            ### Response:\n            ", "### Instruction:\n            I take variable b, double it, and add four.
